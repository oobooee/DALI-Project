# DALI-Project
The AALS DALI project for the 2023/2024 academic year at the University of L'Aquila

This project has been realized with the SICSTUS PROLOG 4.9 Version over a Student license and with the support of the tool AutoHotkey version 2.0 under a GNU public license.
The goal for using AutoHotkey was to easly simulate the injection of events (inside the user panel) from interfaces like ralay, memory timers, video camera alerts and more.

1. After cloning the repo: https://github.com/AAAI-DISIM-UnivAQ/DALI
is mandatory to update Windows Sicstus path inside the startmas.bat file.
2. Edit the startmas.ahk and lunch it, or start the startmas.bat file.
3. Attached you can find demo videos of a typical situation or a faulty situation where the task assigned to a faulty agent has been replaced by a functional one.
