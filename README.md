# DALI-Project
The AALS DALI project 

This project has been realized with the SICSTUS PROLOG 4.9 Version over a Student license and with the support of the tool AutoHotkey version 2.0 under a GNU public license.
The goal for using AutoHotkey was to easly simulate the injection of events (inside the user panel) fron interfaces like ralay, memory timers, video camera alerts and more.

After cloning the repo: https://github.com/AAAI-DISIM-UnivAQ/DALI
is mandatory to update Windows Sicstus path inside the startmas.bat file.
